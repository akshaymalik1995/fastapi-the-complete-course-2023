Hi and welcome. If you're willing to learn how to build full stack and restful applications using FastAPI, then this course is for you.

In this course, I walk you through step by step how to go from never creating a fast API application before to having a full stack FastAPI application deployed live for anyone to use.

This course is not just about teaching you how to create a FastAPI application. Yes, Fastapi is the main subject of the course and it sets the scope of what FastAPI can deliver to you and your team. And yes, this course will deliver all knowledge you may need for the standards of FastAPI. But on top of giving you all the knowledge to progress as a FastAPI dev, I will give you the perfect balance between full stack development and a FastAPI career.

Now FastAPI is one of the most loved and most wanted web frameworks and technologies based on the stackoverflow's yearly community survey. Due to how much individuals love FastAPI, the market is adjusting, which means FastAPI developers are becoming more and more in demand and needed throughout the industry.

Companies of any size can leverage FastAPI to scale their businesses. I explain all main concepts of FastAPI from the ground up and no prior knowledge of FastAPI is needed for this course.

The only thing you need is some basic python knowledge and if you need to brush up on your skills, I have an entirely dedicated section to re-learning Python.

Throughout this course, I go into a lot of detail about how to develop FastAPI applications. I don't just walk through code examples. Instead, I also dive deep into the fundamentals to make sure you learn and understand all the topics of FastAPI.

Many of these fundamentals are covered in slides to help break down the coding examples into easily digestible pieces of information.

To make sure you are understanding all main concepts and principles of fast API there are many quizzes scattered within the course so that you are continually able to practice throughout the course to make sure you fully understand all concepts.

FastAPI is an amazing web framework and I want you to be able to leverage all resources so you can continue to grow within your career.
