Title: FastAPI Overview

---

Hey, everybody, and welcome to another lecture with Coding with Robi.

In this lecture, we're going to be going over the FastAPI overview.

### What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a Python web framework. A web framework means that FastAPI aims to keep everything simple, scalable, and extensible for you as the developer.

Now, the "fast" in FastAPI has a double meaning.

1. **Performance:** FastAPI is one of the fastest performing web frameworks on the market. Not only is the performance as fast as lightning, but it also includes data validation, serialization, documentation, and more.

2. **Development Speed:** With only a few lines of code, you can have your first RESTful API ready for deployment. FastAPI is designed to handle much of the development needed to create RESTful APIs.

### Key Features of FastAPI:

- **Reduced Bugs:** FastAPI allows you to develop APIs with fewer bugs through embedded data validation, resulting in a reduction of about 40% of human errors and bugs.

- **Quick and Easy:** Designed with the developer in mind, FastAPI is quick and easy to use, saving you time to build amazing products.

- **Robust:** Get production-ready code with automatic and dynamic documentation. FastAPI follows development standards using the open API standards and JSON schema.

### Where does FastAPI fit in the Application Architecture?

1. **Web Page:** This is what the user interacts with.
2. **Server:** Your FastAPI application, handling all business logic for the web page. FastAPI ensures the web page gets correct and secure data.

### Who Uses FastAPI?

Many companies, including Netflix, Uber, and Microsoft, have used or are currently using FastAPI.

### Why Use a Web Framework?

While you may be able to write everything yourself, web frameworks like FastAPI provide a simplified way for rapid development, incorporating years of development for a secure and fast application.

This wraps up the FastAPI overview, and I'll see you in the next video.
