**Introduction**

Hi and welcome to this course! You're on your first step to gaining FastAPI knowledge and building RESTful and full-stack applications deployed live.

Before we jump in, let's go over the course outline because this course is packed with content. We are almost done with the introduction where we learn about the FastAPI overview and how to make the most out of this course.

---

**Getting Started**

Right after this, we will dive right into getting Python and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed on your personal machine. The first thing we'll do is go over what we expect to accomplish in Project one.

The first project will cover many different areas of FastAPI to get you going. We'll be creating an optional virtual environment on your computer to separate this project's dependencies from other projects you may have. Then, we'll create your FastAPI project and develop your first RESTful API within minutes.

When we create your first API, you'll see why FastAPI is becoming a fan-favorite lightweight framework for your Python applications.

**Swagger and CRUD Operations**

We will then dive headfirst into Swagger, a dynamic document for APIs, and HTTP request methods, so you know exactly how to maneuver professionally when dealing with APIs. We'll be covering all CRUD operations that make RESTful APIs powerful to work with, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

After this, we start Project two.

---

**Creating Python Objects**

Project two is where we start creating real Python objects and begin to send objects from the client to the server and back using request bodies. Here's where we learn about Pydantic and how to properly create Python classes and handle errors using HTTP exceptions to send the client proper status codes. We will also learn about forms and OAuth2 bearer forms, a special way for a client to send sensitive data from the client to the server.

Now, at this point, we start jumping into Project three.

**Professional Database and Authentication**

Project three is jam-packed with amazing features that will make you a professional engineer. We'll cover how to create a well-structured application with many different endpoints and work with a fully-fledged professional database. This will allow you to save information and bring a full circle to all the CRUD operations.

And what is an application without full authentication and authorization? Yeah, you got that right. We will be implementing full authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). I will walk you step by step on how to implement this into a professional skill set using our favorite Python framework.

---

**Routing and Data Migrations**

After learning about authorization and authentication, we jump right into routing. Routing is where we learn how to create and use FastAPI with larger scale applications. Following routing, we will get into ORM (Object Relational Mapper) and data migrations, where we learn how to change and optimize our databases for FastAPI.

---

**Full Stack Application**

And following ORM is our full-stack application. This is where things really get interesting, and we implement an entire web application where users will have their own data and authentication.

Lastly is the deployment section. This is where you can upload your application to be used by anyone in the world.

**Conclusion**

Now, this is all super exciting stuff, and I can't wait to go on this journey with you step by step. This wraps up the course content, and I will see you in the next video.
